## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and modern hooks
- **Styling**: CSS with CSS variables and responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with automated deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Authentication**: Spotify OAuth 2.0 PKCE Flow

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- GitHub account
- Spotify Developer account

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd top-albums
npm run install:all
```

### 2. Spotify App Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Create a new application
3. Add these redirect URIs:
   - **Production**: `https://mtonsmann.github.io/top-albums/#/callback`
   - **Development**: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/callback`
4. Copy your **Client ID** (you'll need this)

### 3. Environment Configuration

```bash
cd frontend
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Spotify credentials:
```env
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/callback
```

### 4. Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Simply push to main branch - GitHub Actions will auto-deploy!

## Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/                 # React application
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # React components
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/        # React contexts (Auth)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx         # Main app component
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tsx        # App entry point

```

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Connect with Spotify" button
2. Redirected to Spotify OAuth page
3. User authorizes the app
4. Spotify redirects back with authorization code
5. App exchanges code for access token using PKCE
6. User can now view their top songs

### Album Ranking Methodology
- We fetch your top tracks (user-selectable volume, paged in batches of 50)
- Filter to tracks where the album release date starts with the current year (YYYY)
- Group tracks by album; each track contributes a rank-based weight (higher-ranked songs contribute more)
- Albums are sorted by total score, then by number of contributing tracks, then best individual song rank
- Albums with only one contributing top song are excluded

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run install:all` - Install all dependencies

### Adding New Features

The app is structured to easily add new features:
- **New Components**: Add to `frontend/src/components/`
- **New Pages**: Add routes in `App.tsx`
- **Styling**: Use CSS variables in `index.css` for consistency

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Setup

1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Set source to **Deploy from a branch**
3. Select **gh-pages** branch
4. Your app will be available at `https://mtonsmann.github.io/top-albums`

### Automated Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) automatically:
- Builds the React app
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Runs on every push to main branch

## Future Features

- [ ] **Album Recommendations** - Suggest albums based on top songs
- [ ] **Followed Artists Releases** - List albums released this year by artists you follow that are missing from your top albums
- [ ] **Music Discovery** - Find new artists and genres
- [ ] **Playlist Creation** - Generate playlists from recommendations
- [ ] **Social Features** - Share music taste with friends
- [ ] **Analytics** - Detailed listening statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid redirect URI" error**
   - Check that your redirect URI exactly matches what's in Spotify Dashboard
   - Ensure you're using the hash format (`#/callback`) for HashRouter
   - Verify both local and production URIs are registered

2. **"CORS error" in development**
   - The app uses PKCE flow, so CORS shouldn't be an issue
   - Make sure you're using the correct redirect URI for development

3. **Build fails on GitHub Actions**
   - Check that all dependencies are properly installed
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
