## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- GitHub account
- Spotify Developer account

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd top-albums
npm run install:all
```

### 2. Spotify App Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Create a new application
3. Add these redirect URIs:
   - **Production**: `https://your-username.github.io/top-albums/callback`
   - **Development**: `http://localhost:3000/callback`
4. Copy your **Client ID** (you'll need this)

### 3. Environment Configuration

```bash
cd frontend
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Spotify credentials:
```env
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-username.github.io/top-albums/callback
```

### 4. Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or simply push to main branch - GitHub Actions will auto-deploy!

```

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Connect with Spotify" button
2. Redirected to Spotify OAuth page
3. User authorizes the app
4. Spotify redirects back with access token in URL hash
5. App extracts token and stores it securely
6. User can now view their top songs

### Top Songs Display
- Fetches user's top tracks from Spotify API
- Supports different time ranges (4 weeks, 6 months, all time)
- Beautiful grid layout with album artwork
- Links directly to Spotify for each track

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to GitHub Pages
- `npm run install:all` - Install all dependencies

### Adding New Features

The app is structured to easily add new features:
- **New Components**: Add to `frontend/src/components/`
- **New Pages**: Add routes in `App.tsx`
- **Styling**: Use CSS variables in `index.css` for consistency

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Setup

1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Set source to **Deploy from a branch**
3. Select **gh-pages** branch
4. Your app will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/top-albums`

### Automated Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) automatically:
- Builds the React app
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Runs on every push to main branch

## Future Features

- [ ] **Album Recommendations** - Suggest albums based on top songs
- [ ] **Music Discovery** - Find new artists and genres
- [ ] **Playlist Creation** - Generate playlists from recommendations
- [ ] **Social Features** - Share music taste with friends
- [ ] **Analytics** - Detailed listening statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid redirect URI" error**
   - Check that your redirect URI exactly matches what's in Spotify Dashboard
   - Ensure no trailing slashes or typos

2. **"CORS error" in development**
   - The app uses Implicit Grant Flow, so CORS shouldn't be an issue
   - Make sure you're using the correct redirect URI for development

3. **Build fails on GitHub Actions**
   - Check that all dependencies are properly installed
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
